              <p>The one hundred and first meridian was passed.</p>
              <p>
                Mr.Fogg and his partners had resumed their game; no one--not
                even the dummy-- complained of the length of the trip. Fix had
                begun by winning several guineas, which he seemed likely to
                lose; but he showed himself a not less eager whist-player than
                Mr.Fogg. During the morning, chnace distinctly favoured that
                gentleman. Trumps and honours were showered upon his hands.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once, having resolved on a bold stroke, he was on the point of
                playing a spade, when a voice behind him said, "I should play a
                diamond."
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Fix raised their heads, and beheld Colonel
            Proctor.
          </p>
          <p>Stamp Proctor and Phileas Fogg recognised each other at once.</p>
          <p>
            "Ah! it's you, is it, Englishman?" cried the colonel; "it's you who
            are going to play a spade!"
          </p>
          <p>
            "And who plays it," replied Phileas Fogg coolly, throwing down the
            ten of spades.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Well, it pleases me to have it diamonds," replied Colonel Proctor,
            in an insolent tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            He made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been
            played, adding, "You don't understand anything about whist."
