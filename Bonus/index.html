          <h1>Around the World in 80 Days</h1>
          <h3>by Jules Verne</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>The one hundred and first meridian was passed.</p>
          <p>
            Mr.Fogg and his partners had resumed their game; no one--not even
            the dummy-- complained of the length of the trip. Fix had begun by
            winning several guineas, which he seemed likely to lose; but he
            showed himself a not less eager whist-player than Mr.Fogg. During
            the morning, chnace distinctly favoured that gentleman. Trumps and
            honours were showered upon his hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once, having resolved on a bold stroke, he was on the point of
            playing a spade, when a voice behind him said, "I should play a
            diamond."
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Fix raised their heads, and beheld Colonel
            Proctor.
          </p>
          <p>Stamp Proctor and Phileas Fogg recognised each other at once.</p>
          <p>
            "Ah! it's you, is it, Englishman?" cried the colonel; "it's you who
            are going to play a spade!"
          </p>
          <p>
            "And who plays it," replied Phileas Fogg coolly, throwing down the
            ten of spades.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Well, it pleases me to have it diamonds," replied Colonel Proctor,
            in an insolent tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            He made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been
            played, adding, "You don't understand anything about whist."
